title: Host your learnr tutorial on your own shiny server
---
Congrats! Now you have configured the shiny server on your virtual machine. To host your learnr tutorial, you need to place the tutorial file (.Rmd) in the correct folder via the command `scp` that transfers your file securely to the virtual machine.

```
sudo scp [local_file] [remote_username]@[host_address]:/srv/shiny-server/[remote_folder]
```
The `sudo scp` command allows you to transfer the `[local_file]` to the folder `/srv/shiny-server/[remote_folder]` on the remote server `[remote_username]@[host_address]`.  To use this code, change the following: 

- `[local_file]`: The path and name of the file we want to copy
- `[remote_username]`:  Your username on the virtual machine
- `[host_address]`: The host address of your virtual machine
- `[remote_folder]`: The directory you want to copy the file into

#### Example
```
sudo scp /Users/sshan/tutorial.Rmd sshan@rshiny.mtholyoke.edu:/srv/shiny-server/sshan/
```
#### Your tutorial is now up in the air
Viola! You have just uploaded and deployed your first learnr tutorial on the shiny server. You can view it by going to that folder's URL listened on the IP address `138.110.84.108`  with port `3838`. 
```
http://http://138.110.84.108:3838/sshan/tutorial.Rmd
```
If you forgot what your IP address is,  you can find out by the `hostname -I` command. 

# Other useful commands

- Connect to your virtual machine:    `ssh [username]@[host_address]`
- Change the current directory:   `cd [new_directory]` 
- Made a new folder :   `mkdir [new_directory]`
