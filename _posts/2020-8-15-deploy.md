title: Host your first interactive tutorial on your shiny server
---
Congrats! Now you have configured the shiny server on your virtual machine. To host your interactive tutorial, you need to place the tutorial file (.Rmd) in the correct folder via the command `scp` that transfers your file securely to the virtual machine.

```
sudo scp [local_file] [remote_username]@[host_address]:/srv/shiny-server/[remote_folder]
```
The `sudo scp` command allows you to transfer the `[local_file]` to the folder `/srv/shiny-server/[remote_folder]` on the remote server.  To use this code, change the following: 

- `[local_file]`: The path and name of the file we want to copy
- `[remote_username]`:  Your username on the virtual machine
- `[host_address]`: The IP address of your virtual machine
- `[remote_folder]`: The directory you want to copy the file into

#### Example
```
sudo scp /Users/sshan/tutorial.Rmd sshan@rshiny.mtholyoke.edu:/srv/shiny-server/sshan/
```
#### Your tutorial is now up in the air
Viola! You have just uploaded and deployed your first interactive tutorial on the shiny server. You can view it by going to that folder's URL on the IP. 
```
http://http://138.110.84.108:3838/sshan/tutorial.Rmd
```

If you forgot what your IP is on the remote server, you can find out by the `hostname -I` command.

# Other useful commands

- Connect to your virtual machine:    `ssh [username]@[host_address]`
- Change the current directory:   `cd [new_directory]` 
- Made a new folder :   `mkdir [new_directory]`
