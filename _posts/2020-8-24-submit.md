title: How to submit your quiz/exercise to moodle assignment
---

Congratulations! You have just completed the quiz/exercise on the daily formative assignments. The next step is to export the quiz/exercise to a .pdf file and submit it on moodle. This tutorial will give you a step-by-step guidance on how to submit your assignment on moodle.

## Step 1: export the assignment into .pdf file
The common browsers usually have a `print` option in the `File` tab. Here, I have a Chrome browser on an iOS system. The `File` tab usually locates at the top left corner. Click on the `print` button after in the drop-down menu.

Now, select `save as pdf` in the printing options. 

## Step 2: save your file name in the correct format. 
Name your pdf file in the format of `01quiz_lastname.pdf`. 

## Step 3: upload your .pdf file on moodle. 
Find the right submission portal on moodle.

There is a simplification of step 1. Use the `export as pdf` button in the `File` tab.
